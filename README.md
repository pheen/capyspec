## Starter for a Standalone Rspec/Capybara Test Suite

* * *

Boilerplate code to quickly get started with Rspec and Capybara. The intention was to provide a script where you can simply drop in the code generated by [Capycorder](http://polarblau.com/2012/06/04/capycorder-beta-released.html).

### Install

1. `git clone https://github.com/pheen/capyspec.git`

2. `cd capyspec`

3. `bundle install`

### Usage

(an example spec can be found at `spec/github_spec.rb`)

1. Set `Capybara.app_host = ...` to the site you're testing and replace the sample spec with your own or ones recorded from Capycorder.

2. In the terminal type `rspec` to run the suite.

### Helpful Information

The `spec` folder exists for organization and because it's rspec's default expectation (as is ending your file names with `_spec`). It an also be easily moved to an existing project later on for CI.

To get started I would suggest capybara’s github page [https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). It can be quickly skimmed for the most part except for the section [Using Capybara With Rspec](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#using-capybara-with-rspec), and [The DSL](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#the-dsl) through [Exactness](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#exactness).

I would also suggest the first video of Codeschool’s Rspec course [http://rspec.codeschool.com/levels/1](http://rspec.codeschool.com/levels/1) (little over 8 minutes).
